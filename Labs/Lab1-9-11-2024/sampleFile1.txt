The BA in Animation emphasizes animation principles and animation production within a broad Liberal Arts context. In 2016, Animation Career Review ranked DePaul Animation the #16 animation program in the U.S. The student in the Animation BA will be able to draw creatively innovative connections between animation and other subjects of inspiration. This program emphasizes the art of animation, creativity, and critical thinking. Students are introduced to the foundation skills of animating, and then take the production sequence, in which they are expected to bring a broad intellectual and creative viewpoint, influenced by their Liberal Studies courses and electives, to their work. Students can experiment with the latest in animation software, tools, and technologies including hand-drawn, 3D, stop motion, motion capture, motion control, and green screen studios. This is an extremely flexible degree with an emphasis on interdisciplinary learning and self-directed exploration.
